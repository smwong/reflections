Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When you initialize a repository, you're preparing to make a commit. It tells git what files a commit will contain.

Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It allows you to organize and curate what a commit will contain before it actually is saved.
