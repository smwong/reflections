When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
> When a project needs to be accessible by more than one person, like say with a group project or an app with a lot of people working on it. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
> Pulling changes automatically may cause commits to be pulled that I didn't want pulled or clutter it up. I'd rather choose when it happens.
